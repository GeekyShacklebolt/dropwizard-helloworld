# DropWizard HelloWorld
A simple [DropWizard](https://www.dropwizard.io/en/latest/) HelloWorld API created from scratch with Minimal code.

This app I created by heavily taking references form [DropWizard Getting Started Guide](https://www.dropwizard.io/en/latest/getting-started.html), not by generating directly with an [archetype](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html).

I have documented my experience of developing this app in a blog post on [A Habit of Learning](https://geekyshacklebolt.wordpress.com/2021/01/06/dropwizard-helloworld-api-from-scratch/).

Thank you!
